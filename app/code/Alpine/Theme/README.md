# Alpine_Theme

This extension assigns the accuride theme to the store via install script and provides a slider configurator/search tool  

## How it works:
The tool will render a form with several select menus where the customer can select several attribute values and serach for sliders
matching the criteria.

### Attributes used in the selection/configuration:
  * market
  * length
  * side_space
  * load_rating
  * special_features
  * finish
  * material
  * mounting 
  *extension

## Assign to pages
A block is provided from this extension and a template for it which is separated and located within the accuride theme
The block configured with this template can be added to cms pages and static blocks or assigned via layout xml

## Where is it used
Initially update scripts from Alpine_CmsSetup added the selector to the following pages:
  * Page Shop
  * Page Products
  * Home
  
It appears that it has been removed from those pages since
