                    <p>As a global manufacturer that purchases a sizeable amount of materials and services, Accuride International is committed to ensuring our extended supply chain sources act in a socially responsible manner.
                        Accuride corporate headquarters is located in California; therefore, the company also adheres to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, which requires manufacturers doing business in California with worldwide sales grossing more than $100 million dollars to disclose the company's efforts towards eradicating Slavery and Human Trafficking throughout their supply chain.
                        Accuride also conducts ongoing audits with suppliers to ensure there is no use of forced, bonded, indentured labor, or involuntary prison labor.

            <h3>Care for our Environment</h3>
            <h4>The Journey of Green</h4>
            <p>The environment has long been a priority for Accuride and over the years, we've continued to implement practices to ensure that when we take care of business, we also take care of the environment. There are a number of things Accuride does to be environmentally conscious. Some actions are small, while others are major changes in manufacturing processes, such as the revisions made to our plating process.</p>

                    <p>RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) compliance means products (and waste) contain minimal levels of lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, PBB, and PBDE. Back in July 2005, Accuride began changing the plating process from Hexavalent to Trivalent to adhere to the standards set forth in the RoHS Directive.</p>

                    <p>Today, all Accuride slides and components such as bumpers and plastic housings are RoHS compliant. This has reduced exposure to hazardous substances throughout the entire product chain, from the manufacturing staff to the consumer.</p>

                    <p>Through process improvements, Accuride reduced the number of plating machines in our Mexicali, Mexico plant by one-third, while maintaining the same level of production. This saved a significant amount of electricity, natural gas, and water.</p>

                    <p>Compressed air plays a part in slide manufacturing and the Accuride engineering team developed an innovative method to maintain system pressurization that reduced the load (and energy required to support that load) by 10 to 20%.</p>
