                <h3>Our History</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1962, Accuride began as a small tool and die shop producing top-quality slides for tape drives and copy machines. Filling a market need for precision slide products, Accuride rapidly expanded, growing the product line and moving into a broad range of markets and applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, Accuride has nearly 1 million square feet of manufacturing space around the world and is the largest company in the world dedicated to the innovative design and manufacture of sliding hardware.

                <p>
                    Accuride can reliably handle projects of any size. We purchase more than 100,000,000 pounds of steel per year and have in-house steel mills that offer the advantage of design and production flexibility. As the largest zinc plating manufacturer in the world, we plate over 75,000,000 sq. ft. of material per year. Accuride was the first slide manufacturer to electrocoat ball bearing slides and we've developed finishes that vigorously resist corrosion.
