    <h1>About Slides</h1>

    <p>Just in case you don't live and breathe slide products, the following information will help you gain a better understanding about the phrases we use when determining your ideal movement solution, how slides work, and their components.</p>

                    <p>If you cut through a slide at a right angle to the direction of slide movement, you see a cross section of the slide components. Cross section illustrations include dimensions for the width and height of a product. These dimensions are important to planning drawer size and side space requirements.</p>

                    <p>A detent is a feature that uses friction or interference to hold a slide in a particular position. Most Accuride slides have a hold-in detent, to ensure drawers stay closed and do not drift back open. A hold-out detent keeps drawers in an extended position; extra force is required to overcome the detent to close the drawer.</p>

                    <p>Slides with a disconnect feature allow you to remove the drawer (or drawer member) for mounting and other purposes. There are four types of disconnects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Lever disconnect:</strong> A lever on the drawer member releases it from the intermediate member. Disconnect is achieved by pulling the drawer firmly though the resistance of the ball retainer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rail disconnect:</strong> Rails are mounted to the drawer or moving element of the installation. There are two types of rail disconnects. The most common has a latch that is lifted to disengage the rail from the slide. The other style does not have a latch; the drawer is lifted off the slides.</li>
                        <li><strong>Friction disconnect:</strong> No levers or latches are required to remove the drawer. Disconnect is achieved by pulling the drawer firmly through the resistance of the ball retainer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Push-latch:</strong> A latch is pressed to release the drawer member. Disconnect is achieved by pulling the drawer firmly though the resistance of the ball retainer.</li>
