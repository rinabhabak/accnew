                    <p>Whether the slides are intended to hold a drawer, door, component, or chassis, the width of the pull-out unit has a large effect on performance. If the slide does not have the strength and load capacity that corresponds to the width, it can cause racking or side-to-side movement. Excessive racking causes instability and can result in drawer failure.</p>

                    <p>Take note of the maximum recommended drawer widths for the slide products you are considering. When widths are 24" or greater, adding stability by using a slide with a larger cross section and a higher load rating is often the best solution.</p>

                    <p>Will the drawer hold dish towels or bricks? Equipment or paper medical gowns? As with drawer width, exceeding the established load rating may cause the drawer to fail. Be sure to include the weight of the drawer into the total anticipated weight the slides will carry. Accuride specifies a maximum load based on specific conditions, such as 18-inch slides mounted on a 16-inch-wide drawer. Refer to the product technical sheet to determine how load capacity is affected if your application calls for a drawer that is deeper or wider than the tested load conditions. Always test the slide in the intended application if it differs from the typical usage for the product.</p>

                    <p>The slide selected for a residential kitchen drawer will be different than a slide chosen for an identically sized drawer in a toolbox. In commercial, institutional, or industrial environments, drawers encounter greater use--and abuse. Think about your intended application and the environment. You will want to select a more robust slide to offset conditions that are more rigorous.</p>
