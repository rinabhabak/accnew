# Accuride_Catalog

This extension replaces the core magento product compare `add` and `remove` controllers 
to allow not selable items to be added for comparision.

This used to work as default and this shops was relying on this feature, however im magento v 2.3.2 the compre module made it impossible to add non selable items (for example out of stock)
